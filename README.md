Project Logistics
The project features three stages, each being one sprint: 

1. Extract the user-level aggregated dataset using SQL.
2. Analyze the A/B test results using statistical methods in spreadsheets and visualizations in Tableau.
3. Create a written report of the A/B test results and optionally record a video presentation
